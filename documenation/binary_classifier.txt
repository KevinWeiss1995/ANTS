Neural Network Binary Classifier Code Walkthrough

1. IMPORTS AND SETUP
-------------------
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import os
import subprocess
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Input, backend as K

These imports provide:
- Data handling (pandas, numpy)
- File operations (os)
- Command execution (subprocess)
- Model evaluation tools (sklearn.metrics)
- Cross-validation (KFold)
- Deep learning framework (tensorflow/keras)

2. FOCAL LOSS FUNCTION
---------------------
def focal_loss(gamma=2., alpha=.25):

This is a special loss function that:
- Helps focus on hard-to-classify examples
- Reduces impact of easy examples
- Helps with class imbalance
- gamma=2: How much to focus on hard examples
- alpha=0.25: Balance between classes

3. MODEL ARCHITECTURE
--------------------
def create_model(input_shape):

Creates a neural network that:
- Starts with high dropout (0.7) to prevent early overfitting
- Uses residual connections (skip connections)
- Has progressive dropout reduction (0.7 → 0.4 → 0.3 → 0.2)
- Uses batch normalization for stability
- Ends with binary classification (sigmoid)

4. DATA LOADING
--------------
base_repo = get_git_repo_root()
data_dir = os.path.join(base_repo, 'data', 'network')
# Load data...

- Finds project root directory
- Loads training and test data
- Shuffles training data randomly
- Converts to numpy arrays

5. CROSS-VALIDATION SETUP
------------------------
kfold = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

- Splits data into 5 folds
- Allows testing model on different data splits
- Ensures robust evaluation

6. TRAINING LOOP
---------------
For each fold:

# Warmup phase
warmup_model = create_model(X.shape[1])
warmup_model.layers[1].rate = 0.9

- Creates initial model with very high dropout
- Trains for 5 epochs to prevent early overfitting

# Main training
model = create_model(X.shape[1])
history = model.fit(...)

- Trains main model with warmed-up weights
- Uses early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Monitors validation loss
- Uses focal loss for better learning

7. MODEL SAVING AND VERIFICATION
------------------------------
keras_path = os.path.join(model_dir, 'network_binary_classifier.keras')
final_model.save(keras_path)

- Saves trained model
- Verifies it loads correctly
- Tests on holdout test set

OVERALL GOALS
------------
The overall goal is to:
1. Create a robust network traffic classifier
2. Handle class imbalance effectively
3. Prevent overfitting through:
   - Dropout
   - Early stopping
   - Cross-validation
4. Focus on hard examples using focal loss
5. Ensure model generalizes well
